## The Customer Support Challenge

Swedish SMEs face a common challenge: customer inquiries are growing, but hiring more support staff isn't always feasible. Traditional chatbots frustrate users with their rigid, rule-based responses. There's a better way.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with your company's specific knowledge base. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems:

1. **Retrieve** relevant documents from your internal knowledge base
2. **Augment** the context provided to the AI with these documents
3. **Generate** accurate, contextual responses

## Real-World Impact

When implemented correctly, RAG systems deliver measurable improvements:

- **Response time**: From hours to seconds
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% first-response resolution
- **Cost**: 60-70% reduction in support ticket handling costs

## Is RAG Right for Your Business?

RAG works best when you have:

- Existing documentation (FAQs, manuals, knowledge bases)
- Repetitive customer inquiries
- Need for 24/7 availability
- Multilingual support requirements

## Getting Started

At VDS, we start with a **Discovery engagement** to assess whether RAG is the right solution for your specific use case. We analyze your data quality, identify gaps, and provide an honest recommendation—including when simpler solutions might work better.
